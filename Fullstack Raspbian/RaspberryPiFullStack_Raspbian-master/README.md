The objective of this course is to take you to a whirlwind tour of the Raspberry Pi, and introduce you to everything that is great about it.

Structured as a project, you will become familiar with the various components that make up the web development stack: the operating system, the hardware (including the GPIOs), the application server, web server, database server, and the Python programming language.

You will also become familiar with Cloud services that you will integrate into your Raspberry Pi-powered web application.

You application will take sensor data and make them available to the user via a web interface that is constructed based on jQuery and HTML5.

You will need a Raspberry Pi, a DHT22 sensor, a button, an LED, a few resistors and a breadboard.

If you have a Wifi USB dongle, you will learn how to set it up with your Raspberry Pi.

To make the most from this course, you should be familiar with basic programming and be comfortable with the command line.
